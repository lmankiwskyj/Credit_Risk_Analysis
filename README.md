# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
With the credit dataset from LendingClub machine learning models were used to determine which is better at predicting credit risk.  Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, meaning, the distribution of examples across the known classes is skewed. Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class. Therefore, different techniques to train and evaluate models were used; resampling and ensemble classifiers.

## Results
resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
